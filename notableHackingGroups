<h1> Hacking Groups </h1>

<h2>A list of some notable hacking groups.</h2>

<h3>While Anonymous is probably one of the most recognizable hackers groups in the U.S, many other hacker groups exist. Here are three still active ones:</h3>



<button class="accordion">Bureau 121</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Bureau 121 is a military hacking group consisting of about 18 hundred people. Bureau 121 was created in North Korea, although technology is quite out-dated there. A lot of cyber-attacks have been made against South Korea, like an attempt of hacking the South Korean president’s website.

<button class="accordion">Morpho</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Morpho, also known as Wild Neutron, this group has been active since 2011. They seek monetary gain, and they usually hack tech, pharmaceutical and investment companies. They’ve also managed to hack bigger companies, like Microsoft and Apple.

<button class="accordion">Chaos Computer Club</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>TThis group consisting of mainly german-speaking hackers is one of the only well-known legal grey-hat hacker groups. They gained popularity in the 80s, where they told a postal service, Deutsch Bundespost, that they had flaws in their online system. When the postal service denied the claim, the CCC hacked their system and stole around 135 thousand dollars from them, and later returned it.
